Hello! This is me, Dilip Kushwaha. I am Full Stack Developer based in Bangalore, IN.  

This blog is my third attempt at blogging after Wordpress and Blogger. I like to do experiments with technologies in Web. I have a wide range of experience in developing applications with .NET, Java, Android, JavaScript... 
I love going to tech meetups and conferences to meet and learn from community.

Apart from coding whenever I get time, I read, sleep or dream.

If you want to get in touch, I am on **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/kushdilip)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dilipkushwaha)**.
