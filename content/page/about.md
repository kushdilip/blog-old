Hello! This is me, Dilip Kushwaha. I am Full Stack Developer based in Bangalore, IN.  

I am a programmer on steriods. I love to do experiments with Web technologies. I have expertise in building ambitious apps with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). I am quite comfortable with Node & Express as well. Previouly I have worked on technologies like .NET, Android & Angular.js.

I am also contributing to various opensource projects, look at [github](https://github.com/kushdilip) for more. These projects consist of node modules and few ember addons. I love to read and write clean code. And I don't like `if else` in code hence learning concepts of functional programming.
The next tool in Quiver will be **React.js** which is a cool framework I am learning right now.
I love going to tech meetups and conferences to meet and learn from community.

Apart from coding I'm a huge Batman fan and an aspiring writer. For long stories please head to [medium](https://medium.com/@kushdilip). 

If you want to get in touch, I am on **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/kushdilip)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dilipkushwaha)**.
