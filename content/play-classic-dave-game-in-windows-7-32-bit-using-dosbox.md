Remember the Classic Dave game you might have played more than 10 years ago. That was the first game I played on PC. I liked it a lot. But it's not possible to play Dave directly on Windows 7 32 bit.

In this post I will explain, how to play one of the best classic Dos game on Windows 7 32 bit machine.

- Download Dave game from http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/dangerous-dave/ or this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Ls5oqJy_3pSEhuak5hQzd0Mmc/edit?usp=sharing). Extract it in D:\ directory . It will look like this

- Download DOSBox from http://www.dosbox.com/ or this direct link [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Ls5oqJy_3pZk9XTWxXeXVNWWM/edit?usp=sharing). It's a DOS emulator for windows 7. If you don't have administrator access install in directory other than C:\
Install DOSBox and open it.

-  Type in following command one by one in DOSBox. Press Enter after each command.
```
mount c d:\
c:
cd dave
dave
```
It looks like this
