      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was putting efforts to learn C++ for so many months but didn&amp;rsquo;t find any suitable IDE on which I can practice. Then few months ago, one of my friend introduced me to Qt Creator, as one of the best IDE for C++. During the free time in this summer I gave it a try and started learning the language with the help of a ebook on this IDE. And surprisingly, I found Qt Creator to be perfect in so many ways. Every feature I was looking for previously, is  available in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
